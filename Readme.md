## Features:

<b>Dataset Exploration:</b>
Upload and analyze datasets up to 200 MB in size. The app provides an intuitive interface to explore the dataset's structure, visualize data distributions, and gain insights.

<b>Data Summary :</b>
 Generate descriptive statistics, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for numeric columns. Obtain unique value counts and value frequencies for categorical columns.

<b>Data Visualization:</b> 
Create interactive visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and more. Customize the plot settings and explore relationships between variables.

<b>Missing Data Handling:</b> 
Identify missing values in the dataset and visualize their distribution. Employ various strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or removal.

<b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Perform basic data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, handling outliers, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

<b>Export and Sharing:</b>
 Download the modified dataset or share the analysis results with others by generating shareable URLs.

## Dataset Limitations
>The app supports datasets up to 200 MB in size. If you have a larger dataset, consider sampling or reducing the size for analysis.

>Ensure that your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel) and has a clean structure (no missing headers or inconsistent column types)
